## What is Guilt-free IT support?

Guilt-free IT support costs $30 per month per computer and provides:

- Regular computer maintenance and monitoring for problems
- Dedicated support when you need it
- No hourly fees, call as often as needed

Dedicated support is for consulting, questions, computer issues that can be fixed remotely, and scheduled training on a specific task or procedure that can be provided both quickly and remotely. Other work is fixed at $90 per major issue or project (see details below).

A computer issue is defined as a hardware or software malfunction, infection, failure, or bug that impedes or prevents the user's ability to perform everyday tasks like checking email, accessing the Internet, composing/printing/saving a document, etc. Work would need to be performed on the computer to bring it back to a usable state. **Please note:** Not knowing how to perform a specific task on a computer does not constitute a computer issue, as much as it may seem like so. See item 2 below.

A $45 service charge may be assessed in the following circumstances:

1. Scheduled training on operating system or software use.
2. Requesting ASAP support in the category of computer issue that turns out to be unscheduled training on how to use a computer.
3. Sending an email with **HELP!!!!** in the subject line.
4. Sending an email with a question that starts in the subject line and ends in the body.

## Is anything else included?

[KM Authorized](http://kmauthorized.com) provides free consulting for the purchase of new computers, accessories, or upgrade components. Also provided is free consultation and setup for solutions like file backup and recovery ([Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/partner/af1147)), security and privacy software ([AirVPN](https://airvpn.org/?referred_by=131268), [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)), useful cloud services with smartphone setup ([G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTc2Njc5ODM5), [Mailerlite](http://www.mailerlite.com/a/vvizvzciqh), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/f?3202156), [Freshbooks](https://kmauthorized.freshbooks.com/signup/), [Grammarly](https://gram.ly/GgWj)), photo management and social networking ([Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/), [Instagram](http://instagram.com), [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com)).

Education is a big part of what Guilt-free IT is all about. If you have a question about how to do something, please don't hesitate to call and ask. When leaving a voicemail, text, or email request about how to do something, **please specify a good time of day to return your message other than ASAP.** Having a fast, efficient system is only part of the solution, one must also know how to use it. Let's schedule some time for effective, targeted training.

## What's not included in the $30 per month?

Apple products like the iPhone and MacBook are not supported in any capacity whatsoever.

Examples of work that warrants a one-time $90 support charge (in addition to the $30 per month):

- Remote or in-person software training to learn a specific task or process
- Install, update, or configure specialized or industry-specific software
- Replace or install hardware in person
- Install and configure the operating system
- Attempt repair of non-functioning computer due to virus, malware, rootkit, or ransomware infection
- Physical setup of a new computer
- HIPAA compliance work
- Computer issues or bugs that can't be fixed remotely

## What if I don't want to do the $30 per month plan but still want some support?

Remote support will be billed at $45 per major issue. In-person support will be billed hourly at $90 per hour. There's also a $15 per month plan that falls under this category for support costs. It just provides Webroot antivirus/antimalware plus regular maintenance.

## What if I want to discontinue the service?

Either party may terminate this service agreement at any time for any reason and a refund will be given for the remainder of the term.

## What happens if I don't pay my bill?

As a policy, KM Authorized doesn't do business with clients who neglect to pay an invoice for 90 days or more. The overdue invoices will be written off as bad debt and all IT services discontinued. Sending money after 90 days won't change that. Invoices and late payment reminders are sent to the email address on record in the Freshbooks system. If a client's email address changes, please send the new address to [keegan@kmauthorized.com](mailto:keegan@kmauthorized.com?Subject=New%20email%20address) so that invoices will be sent to the correct inbox. It is not KM Authorized's responsibility to make sure clients read their emails and pay for services they have chosen to use.

### What about a non-disclosure agreement?

KM Authorized LLC and Keegan Mullaney agree not to disclose any and all data that may be viewed during the course of IT support work. A non-disclosure agreement can be provided upon request.
